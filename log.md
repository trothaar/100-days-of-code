# 100 Days Of Code - Captain's Log

### Day 51: May 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Simon game, primarily on the JavaScript. I also made a couple of minor adjustments to the classes and ID's in the HTML to make it easier to manipulate the DOM.

**Thoughts:** This is a difficult challenge because of the interactivity this game has to have; it's way more involved than the Tic Tac Toe game.

### Day 50: May 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I ripped apart my HTML and CSS because I really hated how the game looked. I chose a far more minimalist design. I also began work on the JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** It's taken me four months to get halfway through my "100 Days," but I'm going to keep going. It's difficult to balance this with full-time work, but it can be done.

### Day 49: April 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML and CSS for my Simon game. I had to tear down the CSS because the controls weren't lining up properly. Now, I have them lined up more evenly than the FCC example does!

**Thoughts:** I don't like the on-off switch in the FCC example, which is made to look like the switch on the real Simon game. I find it very confusing to use on a computer, so I'm using Bootstrap buttons to turn the game on and off, like I did for my Tic Tac Toe game. I think that's more user-friendly for a computer version of this game.

### Day 48: April 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After much procrastination, I began work on my Simon game, which is the last project I need to complete to get my Free Code Camp front-end dev certificate.

**Thoughts:** I am struggling to get my coding in while working my part-time job and running my business. I need better time management.

### Day 47: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I built a "Tweet box" with React!

**Thoughts:** This tutorial began making sense to me when I got close to the end. LOL

**Links to work:**
[JS Bin for React Tutorial](http://jsbin.com/xuxopu/edit?js,output)

### Day 46: April 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've done some reading about how to begin the Simon Game, but in the meantime, I wanted to take a couple of hours and go through this rather interesting React tutorial I found: [React.js Introduction for People Who Know Just Enough jQuery to Get By](http://chibicode.com/react-js-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/). I think I might want to build the Simon game in React.

**Thoughts:** I am determined to keep going even when I falter -- primarily due to work -- and miss days.

### Day 45: April 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Tic Tac Toe game and uploaded it to CodePen. Now, it's on to the Simon game.

**Thoughts:** ~~For some odd reason, on CodePen the "Switch to O" button isn't changing class from btn-secondary to btn-primary when it is selected, even though it works fine locally. I suspect it's a weird CodePen thing, so I'm not going to worry about it; the code is correct.~~ CodePen uses Bootstrap 4, and I develop in 3. I deleted their auto-add link and manually added 3, and now, it works fine.

### Day 44: April 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I had despaired over my tic tac toe game, but I finally have an operational model. It's not fancy, but it's no longer fugly, and more importantly, it's operational. I want to do some styling to it before uploading it to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I had to start all over again with my HTML, though since this project didn't require a lot of HTML, that wasn't as bad as it sounded. I did not have to completely trash my JS and jQuery, but I did have to go through it, line by line, and rework a lot of it. I no longer despair over my tic tac toe game!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 43: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts:** I've started all over again, with reworking my HTML.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 42: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts:** I've got to start over with this. It's all jacked up.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 41: April 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts:** My prototype is still ugly and buggy. I mentioned yesterday that I had thought of using an advanced JS library, but now, I'm thinking again. I think I just need to focus on building a simple game in JS and jQuery first.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 40: April 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts:** I have a prototype, but it's fugly, and it has bugs. I think I may need to learn about an advanced JS library like React or Angular to make this look better, which I am willing to do.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 39: April 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I began work on the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts:** This one is probably going to take some time because, to get something that looks even remotely like the example, I'll probably need to try out some new JavaScript libraries.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-tictactoe)

### Day 38: March 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Pomodoro Clock ~~but I can't submit it yet. I developed it locally, then copied & pasted it onto CodePen. Everything runs just fine locally, but on CodePen, my basketball buzzer does not play at the end of the sessions and breaks. ???~~

I figured out what was going on. It was the fault of a Chrome extension I was using to disable HTML5 autoplay audio and video.

**Thoughts:** ~~I was all ready to submit it and move on to the next project, and then this! Very frustrating.~~ 

I should have taken another 15 minutes before writing this.

### Day 37: March 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the Free Code Camp Pomodoro Clock, adding more functions to the JS.

**Thoughts:** The clock is coming along nicely.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Pomodoro Clock Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/pomodoro-clock)

### Day 37: March 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the Free Code Camp Pomodoro Clock. I began the JS and made great progress.

**Thoughts:** I have a lot on my plate, and it's challenging to make sure I code every day. I'm getting up earlier in the a.m. so that I can eat that frog. I am a night owl, so this is no mean feat for me, but I want things to change.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Pomodoro Clock Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/pomodoro-clock)

### Day 36: March 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I screwed up and missed a few days, but I'm back in the game. Today, I began working on the Free Code Camp Pomodoro Clock, setting up the basic HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I've been trying to figure out what direction to go in, other than completing the FCC challenges. I do marketing work for cyber security companies, and I want to get into the technical side of InfoSec. I signed up for Cybrary so that I can start working on the CompTIA A+ certification. According to their roadmap, that's the first one I should go for. I know there's one below that called IT Fundamentals, but I've been told that's probably too easy for me, as I have a math/CIS undergrad degree.

[My FCC Pomodoro Clock Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/pomodoro-clock)

### Day 35: March 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Free Code Camp jQuery calculator is finished and uploaded to CodePen!

**Thoughts:** CodePen just launched a new editing system, CodePen projects. Among other things, it lets you directly upload project files created locally. That is so much easier than having to copy and paste everything!

### Day 34: March 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made great progress on the FCC calculator app.

**Thoughts:** The calculator is nearly done!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Calculator Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-calculator)

### Day 33: March 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I ran a 12-miler and got injured during it (nothing serious), but I still completed my hour o' code. I made some changes to the Calculator's CSS file and began work on the JavaScript file.

**Thoughts:** The calculator's CSS is very basic right now. I'm going to get it fully working, then go back and make it look nicer. 

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Calculator Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-calculator)

### Day 32: March 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After missing a day, I got back to work on the FCC calculator. I began formatting it with CSS. It doesn't do anything yet.

**Thoughts:** Because I was working for so long on JavaScript algorithms, I'd forgotten how to do a bunch of things in CSS. 

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Calculator Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-calculator)

### Day 31: March 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began working on the next FCC challenge, which is to build a JavaScript calculator. I created an HTML file containing the calculator buttons, using Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't used HTML in so long, I'd forgotten how to write comments in it; I was styling them as if they were JavaScript comments!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Calculator Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-calculator)

### Day 30: March 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Pairwise FCC algorithm challenge.

**Thoughts:** I can now move on to the advanced front-end projects, the last challenges I need to complete in order to get my front-end dev certificate.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 29: March 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished two more FCC algorithm challenges, Make a Person and Map the Debris.

**Thoughts:** These were short but important challenges that taught me how to create JavaScript object methods and use various math libraries. I have one more algorithm left before I can proceed to the advanced front-end projects!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 28: March 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed the No Repeats Please challenge and began work on Make a Person.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't the enemy I saw that got me; it was the one I didn't. The RegEx for this problem was actually very simple, and the pattern I used will catch all repeated characters, not just letters. Generating all of the permutations was the difficult part. Save yourself a lot of time and hassle and [check out this very informative blog entry](http://www.knanthony.com/blog/free-code-camp-no-repeats-please/) on this particular challenge.

[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 27: March 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Inventory Update challenge and began work on the No Repeats Please challenge.

**Thoughts:** Inventory Update wasn't that bad, although I had to use three helper functions (at least I did; I'm sure more skilled people didn't, heh). This next one requires RegEx skills, which I'm sure will be tons of fun!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 26: March 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the FCC Exact Change algorithm challenge and moved on to the next one, Inventory Update.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with these algorithms but continue to peck my way through them.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 25: March 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much to report today; continued to work on the FCC algorithm challenge, Exact Change.

**Thoughts:** This is a very difficult problem.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 24: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on the FCC algorithm challenge, Exact Change.

**Thoughts:** This is a very difficult problem.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 23: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I began work on the next FCC algorithm challenge, Exact Change.

**Thoughts:** The first step is to figure out how to deal with the currency calculations. Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not recognize floating-point numbers.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 22: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed two more FCC algorithm challenges: Record Collection and Symmetric Difference.

**Thoughts:** Only six more algorithm challenges before I can move onto the advanced front-end projects, then claim my hard-won front-end certificate!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 21: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After losing a few days because I went to Orlando to run a half marathon, I got back to work and finished the FCC U.S. phone numbers challenge

**Thoughts:** I'd like to do a more robust validator that strips out dashes, hypens, parens, and even periods to give users more leeway, and that recognizes that no 555 numbers are valid other than 555-1212.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)


### Day 20: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I began the Free Code Camp Advanced Algorithms section and started working on the Validate U.S. Phone Numbers challenge.

**Thoughts:** This one is really hard, as my RegEx skills are lacking. I'm going through the problem piece by piece, and I have a couple of cases working.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 19: February 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed the FCC Arguments Optional algorithm, which completes the intermediate algorithms section! Now, I can move on to the advanced algorithms.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about how to work with the Arguments object, as well as how to return a function.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 18: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC algorithm No. 283, Everything Be True.

**Thoughts:** Iterating through the key-value pairs of complex objects still confuses me, but I got it done. I have one more algorithm to do before completing the intermediate algorithms section!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 17: February 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I had to miss yesterday because [the internet got knocked out in Jacksonville](http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/widespread-comcast-outage-in-ne-florida) after a road worker severed a fiber optic line. I got back on track today and completed FCC algorithm No. 282, Binary Agents.

**Thoughts:** I'm really glad that, before I began work on this problem, I did some research and found the parseInt() function to automatically convert from binary to Unicode. Otherwise, I would have ended up with some really, really ugly code.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 16: February 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC algorithm challenge no 281, Steamroller.

**Thoughts:** I learned about the spread operator and ES6. I don't completely grasp ES6 yet, but I have a rudimentary understanding of how the spread operator works. It saves a lot of code in scenarios like this one.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 15: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC algorithm challenge nos. 279 & 280: Finders Keepers and Drop It, and began working on No. 281.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning more about how to pass functions as parameters. I thought Finders Keepers would be hard, but I completed it in only a few minutes!

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 14: February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC algorithm challenge nos. 277 & 278: Sum All Primes and Smallest Common Multiples.

**Thoughts:** The primes one was relatively easy because I was able to repurpose some of my code from the Fibonacci program I wrote yesterday.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 13: February 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC algorithm challenge no. 276: Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers.

**Thoughts:** I misunderstood the instructions at first and wrote a program that calcuated the first n Fibonacci numbers and placed them into an array. I ended up with some huge-ass numbers! LOL I decided to save that particular function as a separate file and uploaded it, along with the correct answer to the FCC problem.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 12: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After having missed yesterday, I completed three FCC challenges today: Sorted Union, Convert HTML Entities, and Spinal Tap Case.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting better with RegEx, though my proficiency in it still leaves a lot to be desired.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 11: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went in a different direction today and performed a much-needed update to my business site, [Wild Owl Digital](http://wildowldigital.com/). I've been using it to advertise copywriting services, which is how I've made my living for most of the past decade, but I updated it to include web design services. I also completely re-did the design using the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme with customizations, including jQuery code to get the dynamic linking on the home page.

I may do some of the FCC algorithms later, but this needs to take priority so that I can expand my business.

**Thoughts:** I love WordPress Twenty Seventeen. It allows for some pretty cool customization right out of the box, and as I learn more, I'll be able to do more.

**Links to work:**
[Wild Owl Digital](http://wildowldigital.com/)

### Day 10: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed two more FCC algorithm challenges: Missing Letters & Boo Who.

**Thoughts:** Boo Who took only a few minutes to solve. Missing Letters took up most of my time, primarily because I misunderstood the problem at first; I was returning the entire new string instead of just the missing character.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 9: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Pig Latin challenge was bothering me because I'd had to hard-code the consonant cluster case. I went back and fixed the problem so that it will work with all consonant cluster pairs. I also completed the next challenge, DNA Pairing.

**Thoughts:** I need to get better at RegEx; it would have helped me code the Pig Lain solution much more elegantly.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 8: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC intermediate algorithm challenge Nos. 268 & 269, "Search & Replace" and "Pig Latin."

**Thoughts:** I ended up hard-coding the lone consonant cluster case into the Pig Latin program, as I could not get an external function to work. I will revisit this later.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 7: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commenced work on FCC intermediate algorithm challenge No. 268, "Search & Replace."

**Thoughts:** Having to keep the replacement case-sensitive is the sticking point here.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 6: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC intermediate algorithm challenge No. 267, "Wherefore Art Thou."

**Thoughts:** After my "bye" day for yesterday's marathon, which knocked me off my feet, I was right back at it. Today, I learned about the power of the JS .filter() function.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 5: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC intermediate algorithm challenges Nos. 265 and 266.

**Thoughts:** No. 266, the Roman numeral converter, is an ugly, ugly program full of conditionals. Someone more experienced than me probably could have coded this far more elegantly, but I got the job done. I'm glad I finished it; I run the breast cancer half marathon here in Jacksonville tomorrow, so I may have to take a "bye" day. I'm going to see if I can sneak in an hour of code.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)


### Day 4: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started on FCC's intermediate algorithm challenges. I completed No. 264 and began work on No. 265.

**Thoughts:** I began uploading my work onto Github when I first began the basic algorithms section. I'm just going to put all of my FCC algorithms into that repository.

**Links to work:**
[My FCC Algorithms Solutions Repo](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-basic-algorithms)

### Day 3: February 9, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: I didn't make any CSS changes, but I noticed that there were two errors in the JavaScript: The status for the offline users was showing as "null," and the nonexistent test users were not showing up at all. I fixed these problems. I also altered the script to show a placeholder logo if the user existed but had no logo, and the red "don't" sign if the user did not exist.
 
Also, for some bizarre reason, my header row works fine on my desktop, but CodePen didn't like it; it was insisting on putting each column header on a different line. I commented that part of the HTML out, so the CodePen version is a bit different than what you would see if you downloaded the files from Github and looked at the pages in your browser.

**Thoughts:** I'm thrilled to be done with this project. Now, I'm moving on to intermediate and advanced algorithims. Then, I do the advanced front-end projects, and finally, I can claim my front-end FCC certificate!

### Day 2: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've pretty much finished the TwitchTV project, although I think I want to make some more tweaks to the CSS before uploading it to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I can't say enough good things about the [Coding Tutorials 360 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Wi_NYysX-LfcqT3Hq9Faw). Without these videos, I'd still be scratching my head. I really like how he taught how to pull the FCC followers directly from TwitchTV instead of hard-coding them, and how he taught us how to get a client ID and use .ajax instead of .getJSON.

[My TwitchTV API Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/fcc-twitchtv)

### Day 1 [Reboot]: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I missed a bunch of days, but I am not giving up, because if I do, I will never achieve my goal of becoming a developer. I decided to simply restart the challenge and commit to doing better this time around. Today, I began work on the TwitchTV API project. I created a cursory HTML and JS file with the help of the [Coding Tutorials 360 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Wi_NYysX-LfcqT3Hq9Faw).

**Thoughts:** I had been struggling as to where to get started on the TwitchTV project. I usually prefer to learn through written materials, but I couldn't find any that would actually teach me how to code this project instead of just showing me what the author did, which was not going to help at all. These videos are about to save my ass. Thanks, Dylan Israel!

### Day 20: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Wikipedia Viewer!

**Thoughts:** Everyone said this would be easy, but it was really hard for me.

[My Wikipedia Viewer Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/wikipedia-viewer)


### Day 19: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer.  

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript/JQuery I'm using currently begins the search on keyup; I want to modify this so that it doesn't do anything until the user presses the enter key or hits the search icon. It looks like the easiest way to accomplish this is to use a button rather than a button-less search bar.

**Links to work:** 
[My Wikipedia Viewer Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/wikipedia-viewer)


### Day 18: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer. I made some changes to the JavaScript and played around with it to see if I could "break" things. I also decided to use a different search box; I didn't like the way the first one looked, so I got a really nice one from a template [here on Bootsnip](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/expanding-search-button-in-css). The look is much cleaner. 

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript/JQuery I'm using currently begins the search on keyup; I want to modify this so that it doesn't do anything until the user presses the enter key or hits the search icon.

### Days 14 - 17: January 20 - 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I haven't been logging, but I have spent considerable time on the Wikipedia viewer over the past four days. I have an operational model, but it still needs work.

**Thoughts:** I am learning more about JQuery and how to work with data fetched from API's.

**Links to work:** 
[My Wikipedia Viewer Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/wikipedia-viewer)

### Day 13: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer. I can't get the search box to do anything.

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn about jQuery and jQuery UI, the latter of which I want to use to format the search box.

**Links to work:** 
[My Wikipedia Viewer Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/wikipedia-viewer)

### Day 12: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: With my weather app done, I have turned my attention to the next FCC challenge: building a Wikipedia viewer. I have my html, js, and css skeleton files set up with code snippets that I snagged for repurposing. The HTML file has a link to a random Wikipedia entry and a search box that doesn't yet do anything.

**Thoughts:** I am learning about search boxes, and I am learning more about API's.

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I now have a functioning weather app that meets all of the FCC user stories, plus provides the current date and time! The design is not fancy, but it's no longer ugly.

**Thoughts:** While completing this project, I learned how to use JQuery to make API requests and make use of the provided data. I also learned about JavaScript date and time functions.

### Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It's still not exciting to look at, but my weather app has an icon now, and it meets every single user story required by FCC. Now that I have a functional app, I can pretty it up with CSS and by adding the date and time that I want.

**Thoughts:** I had wanted to use the really nice icon set I downloaded, but I wasn't sure how well they'd play with CodePen, so I decided to just use the icons provided by Open Weather Map for now.

### Day 9: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have the world's simplest weather app built. It displays the user's location and weather conditions, with a button the user can toggle to switch betwween F/C. There is currently no formatting. The next step is to integrate the weather icons.

**Thoughts:** This week was difficult, and then, I ran a half marathon on Saturday and left everything I had at the race. I am keeping on this 100 days of code thing even though I'm finding I can't push code every single day. Because I'm a beginner, some days, I do more thinking, planning, and learning than actual coding. I'm going to do my best to come as close as possible to coding every day, but the important thing is that I keep going even if I miss a day or two.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It's not very exciting to look at, but I spent some time today [learning about jQuery.get()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/) and how to use it with API's, specifically by playing with some more of [Tyler Moeller's code](https://tylermoeller.net/freecodecamp-weather-app/). I added the user's zip code to the location output.

**Thoughts:** Using jQuery to pull data from API's is a very powerful concept to grasp, and today, I feel I finally "got" it. Now, I can design the weather app that I want, including using the weather icons I downloaded yesterday!

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I hit a snag yesterday when I had to set up a new computer. I'm switching from a Macbook to a Dell running Windows 10, and I haven't run Windows in years. Today, I turned my attention back to the FCC weather app, which is going to be a bear. [This guy explains how to do it step by step,](https://tylermoeller.net/freecodecamp-weather-app/) but I don't want to just copy all of his code, because that's not the point. Also, I want to make my page look different than his. For one thing, I want to incorporate [this rather extensive set of weather icons.](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) I did use his get location function just to get started. I commented out my clock from the HTML file because I think I may want to do something different in that regard.

I also went through W3 Schools' tutorial on AJAX and the JQuery get function, as I think that FCC is lacking in that regard; a Google search showed I'm not the only one who felt that these subjects were glossed over rather quickly.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be really hard, but I'm going to learn a lot.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I encountered an epic failure. I tried very hard to pass a code assessment for a Junior JavaScript Dev job, spending the better part of yesterday and three hours today trying to finish it. However, I couldn't figure out, for the life of me, how to iterate over the complex object in the problem. I finally had to tell the employer I couldn't do it. For more details, see the README file in today's repository.

On the positive side, I learned an awful lot about JavaScript objects from reading dozens and dozens of articles, and I learned how to use console.log to see what's going on with my code (I'd previously used window.alert).

**Thoughts:** This is a big blow. I really want to get out of copywriting and get an entry-level developer job, but "entry-level" jobs are few and far between. All I can do is keep going and hope that someone eventually gives me a break, as I am capable of doing far more than writing copy. I've posted the test here because I really want to know what it was I couldn't see. I'm out of the running for the job, so any advice you give isn't helping me cheat; it's just helping me be ready for the next coding test.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I missed yesterday -- sort of -- due to running a half marathon, then working in the evening. I say "sort of" because I did begin Googling for resources to complete my next project, which is the FCC weather app, but I did not push any code. I also received a JavaScript test for a developer job I applied to, which involves manipulating a complex data structure. However, I will be unable to share that code publicly.

Today, I built the skeleton for my weather app. In addition to the weather, I am going to have it display the date and time at the top of the page. Right now, it displays the date and time, and there's a button for Farenheit and Celsius, but the button does not yet do anything.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be quite challenging, and I may spend more time figuring out how to do things, such as call an API, then I actually will coding. I'm somewhat used to this from my work as a copywriter. I spend far more time researching my articles/blogs/web content than I actually spend writing.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Random Quote Generator is in the refrigerator and uploaded to Codepen!

**Thoughts:** In addition to Tweeting out the quote, the tweetIt() JavaScript function also appends the hashtag "#quote" and the site URL to the end of the Tweet. 

I had thought of modifying the "New Quote" button, but in light of the new background image I selected, I thought that the default looked elegant. Also, I learned how to use Google Fonts to modify the default Bootstrap font, and I learned how to center a footer in Bootstrap.

I decided not to add the clock and date at this time, because I want to move onto the next project. I don't want to get so caught up in doing this one that I spend forever "perfecting" it. I can build a fancier version later.

While searching for instructions on how to Tweet dynamic text, I came across [this interesting page,](http://lab.artlung.com/random-cells/) which has the user choose random words and then Tweet the resulting "quote." I bookmarked it because I may want to duplicate it later.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time making the world's simplest random code generator look a little nicer by editing the CSS. Among other edits, I:

* Added a body onload() so that the page displays an initial random quote upon load.
* Added a background image, which I'll likely change, because the current one may look a little too much like something you'd have seen on an ugly-ass 90s-era Geocities site.
* Replaced the Bootstrap Jumbotron class with a page header and a well to hold the quote.
* Centered the well on the page and made the quote text bigger.

I also added a Twitter icon, but it doesn't currently do anything.

**Thoughts:** I spent some time looking at other students' quote machines and figuring out how I wanted mine to look. I finally decided on a style that was a mash-up between [the original FCC model](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/) and [the Epiphany Clock](http://codepen.io/sok213/full/NqJYzb/). I think I might like to add the date and time at the top, but first, I need to get the Twitter button working so that users can Tweet out the quote.

Finally, I reviewed the difference between a CSS class and a CSS id.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I built the skeleton of the Random Quote Generator, meaning that I put together a very, very simple page with nearly no formatting and no Tweet button. It does not look very nice, but it generates random quotes. My logic is that I wanted to get a simple version working, then build upon it. I also created a repository for this particular project.

I used an array of quotes, as I already had a bunch of inspirational quotes stored in a Word doc; I Tweet them for one of my clients (I work as a marketing consultant, primarily for cyber security firms). 

Additionally, although this isn't code-releated, I put together a Medium publication that I can use to write more extensive blogs regarding this project and other things that I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to get the JavaScript working, as I made a couple of minor syntax errors. I couldn't get the array working at all. It turned out that when I copied and pasted the quotes from a text document, the quotation marks around the quotes messed up the array! Sometimes, it's the simple things that stymie us.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commenced working on the Free Code Camp Random Quote Machine Project. Made a local folder and set up the skeletons for my html, css, and js files, as well as a text file containing the quotes I want to use. Began learning to use GitHub markdown so that I can keep this log.

**Thoughts:** I decided to work on this project locally, using Atom, then upload it to CodePen once it is finished. However, if I'm going to do that, I suppose I need to set up a blog so that I can better share my progress, as I will not have any live files to link to until the end. For now, I'm linking to the FCC instruction page.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
