# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commenced working on the Free Code Camp Random Quote Machine Project. Made a local folder and set up the skeletons for my html, css, and js files, as well as a text file containing the quotes I want to use. Began learning to use GitHub markdown so that I can keep this log.

**Thoughts:** I decided to work on this project locally, using Atom, then upload it to CodePen once it is finished. However, if I'm going to do that, I suppose I need to set up a blog so that I can better share my progress, as I will not have any live files to link to until the end. For now, I'm linking to the FCC instruction page.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
