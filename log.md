# 100 Days Of Code - Captain's Log

### Day 10: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed two more FCC algorithm challenges: Missing Letters & Boo Who.

**Thoughts:** Boo Who took only a few minutes to solve. Missing Letters took up most of my time, primarily because I misunderstood the problem at first; I was returning the entire new string instead of just the missing character.

### Day 9: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Pig Latin challenge was bothering me because I'd had to hard-code the consonant cluster case. I went back and fixed the problem so that it will work with all consonant cluster pairs. I also completed the next challenge, DNA Pairing.

**Thoughts:** I need to get better at RegEx; it would have helped me code the Pig Lain solution much more elegantly.

### Day 8: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC intermediate algorithm challenge Nos. 268 & 269, "Search & Replace" and "Pig Latin."

**Thoughts:** I ended up hard-coding the lone consonant cluster case into the Pig Latin program, as I could not get an external function to work. I will revisit this later.

### Day 7: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commenced work on FCC intermediate algorithm challenge No. 268, "Search & Replace."

**Thoughts:** Having to keep the replacement case-sensitive is the sticking point here.

### Day 6: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC intermediate algorithm challenge No. 267, "Wherefore Art Thou."

**Thoughts:** After my "bye" day for yesterday's marathon, which knocked me off my feet, I was right back at it. Today, I learned about the power of the JS .filter() function.

### Day 5: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC intermediate algorithm challenges Nos. 265 and 266.

**Thoughts:** No. 266, the Roman numeral converter, is an ugly, ugly program full of conditionals. Someone more experienced than me probably could have coded this far more elegantly, but I got the job done. I'm glad I finished it; I run the breast cancer half marathon here in Jacksonville tomorrow, so I may have to take a "bye" day. I'm going to see if I can sneak in an hour of code.

### Day 4: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started on FCC's intermediate algorithm challenges. I completed No. 264 and began work on No. 265.

**Thoughts:** I began uploading my work onto Github when I first began the basic algorithms section. I'm just going to put all of my FCC algorithms into that repository.

### Day 3: February 9, 2017
 
 **Today's Progress**: I didn't make any CSS changes, but I noticed that there were two errors in the JavaScript: The status for the offline users was showing as "null," and the nonexistent test users were not showing up at all. I fixed these problems. I also altered the script to show a placeholder logo if the user existed but had no logo, and the red "don't" sign if the user did not exist.
 
Also, for some bizarre reason, my header row works fine on my desktop, but CodePen didn't like it; it was insisting on putting each column header on a different line. I commented that part of the HTML out, so the CodePen version is a bit different than what you would see if you downloaded the files from Github and looked at the pages in your browser.

**Thoughts:** I'm thrilled to be done with this project. Now, I'm moving on to intermediate and advanced algorithims. Then, I do the advanced front-end projects, and finally, I can claim my front-end FCC certificate!

### Day 2: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've pretty much finished the TwitchTV project, although I think I want to make some more tweaks to the CSS before uploading it to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I can't say enough good things about the [Coding Tutorials 360 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Wi_NYysX-LfcqT3Hq9Faw). Without these videos, I'd still be scratching my head. I really like how he taught how to pull the FCC followers directly from TwitchTV instead of hard-coding them, and how he taught us how to get a client ID and use .ajax instead of .getJSON.

### Day 1 [Reboot]: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I missed a bunch of days, but I am not giving up, because if I do, I will never achieve my goal of becoming a developer. I decided to simply restart the challenge and commit to doing better this time around. Today, I began work on the TwitchTV API project. I created a cursory HTML and JS file with the help of the [Coding Tutorials 360 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Wi_NYysX-LfcqT3Hq9Faw).

**Thoughts:** I had been struggling as to where to get started on the TwitchTV project. I usually prefer to learn through written materials, but I couldn't find any that would actually teach me how to code this project instead of just showing me what the author did, which was not going to help at all. These videos are about to save my ass. Thanks, Dylan Israel!

### Day 20: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Wikipedia Viewer!

**Thoughts:** Everyone said this would be easy, but it was really hard for me.

### Day 19: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer.  

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript/JQuery I'm using currently begins the search on keyup; I want to modify this so that it doesn't do anything until the user presses the enter key or hits the search icon. It looks like the easiest way to accomplish this is to use a button rather than a button-less search bar.

### Day 18: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer. I made some changes to the JavaScript and played around with it to see if I could "break" things. I also decided to use a different search box; I didn't like the way the first one looked, so I got a really nice one from a template [here on Bootsnip](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/expanding-search-button-in-css). The look is much cleaner. 

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript/JQuery I'm using currently begins the search on keyup; I want to modify this so that it doesn't do anything until the user presses the enter key or hits the search icon.

### Days 14 - 17: January 20 - 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I haven't been logging, but I have spent considerable time on the Wikipedia viewer over the past four days. I have an operational model, but it still needs work.

**Thoughts:** I am learning more about JQuery and how to work with data fetched from API's.

[My Wikipedia Viewer Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/wikipedia-viewer)

### Day 13: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Wikipedia viewer. I can't get the search box to do anything.

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn about jQuery and jQuery UI, the latter of which I want to use to format the search box.

### Day 12: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: With my weather app done, I have turned my attention to the next FCC challenge: building a Wikipedia viewer. I have my html, js, and css skeleton files set up with code snippets that I snagged for repurposing. The HTML file has a link to a random Wikipedia entry and a search box that doesn't yet do anything.

**Thoughts:** I am learning about search boxes, and I am learning more about API's.

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I now have a functioning weather app that meets all of the FCC user stories, plus provides the current date and time! The design is not fancy, but it's no longer ugly.

**Thoughts:** While completing this project, I learned how to use JQuery to make API requests and make use of the provided data. I also learned about JavaScript date and time functions.

### Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It's still not exciting to look at, but my weather app has an icon now, and it meets every single user story required by FCC. Now that I have a functional app, I can pretty it up with CSS and by adding the date and time that I want.

**Thoughts:** I had wanted to use the really nice icon set I downloaded, but I wasn't sure how well they'd play with CodePen, so I decided to just use the icons provided by Open Weather Map for now.

[Weather App Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/weather-app)

### Day 9: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have the world's simplest weather app built. It displays the user's location and weather conditions, with a button the user can toggle to switch betwween F/C. There is currently no formatting. The next step is to integrate the weather icons.

**Thoughts:** This week was difficult, and then, I ran a half marathon on Saturday and left everything I had at the race. I am keeping on this 100 days of code thing even though I'm finding I can't push code every single day. Because I'm a beginner, some days, I do more thinking, planning, and learning than actual coding. I'm going to do my best to come as close as possible to coding every day, but the important thing is that I keep going even if I miss a day or two.

[Weather App Repository](https://github.com/trothaar/weather-app)


### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It's not very exciting to look at, but I spent some time today [learning about jQuery.get()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/) and how to use it with API's, specifically by playing with some more of [Tyler Moeller's code](https://tylermoeller.net/freecodecamp-weather-app/). I added the user's zip code to the location output.

**Thoughts:** Using jQuery to pull data from API's is a very powerful concept to grasp, and today, I feel I finally "got" it. Now, I can design the weather app that I want, including using the weather icons I downloaded yesterday!

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I hit a snag yesterday when I had to set up a new computer. I'm switching from a Macbook to a Dell running Windows 10, and I haven't run Windows in years. Today, I turned my attention back to the FCC weather app, which is going to be a bear. [This guy explains how to do it step by step,](https://tylermoeller.net/freecodecamp-weather-app/) but I don't want to just copy all of his code, because that's not the point. Also, I want to make my page look different than his. For one thing, I want to incorporate [this rather extensive set of weather icons.](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) I did use his get location function just to get started. I commented out my clock from the HTML file because I think I may want to do something different in that regard.

I also went through W3 Schools' tutorial on AJAX and the JQuery get function, as I think that FCC is lacking in that regard; a Google search showed I'm not the only one who felt that these subjects were glossed over rather quickly.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be really hard, but I'm going to learn a lot.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I encountered an epic failure. I tried very hard to pass a code assessment for a Junior JavaScript Dev job, spending the better part of yesterday and three hours today trying to finish it. However, I couldn't figure out, for the life of me, how to iterate over the complex object in the problem. I finally had to tell the employer I couldn't do it. For more details, see the README file in today's repository.

On the positive side, I learned an awful lot about JavaScript objects from reading dozens and dozens of articles, and I learned how to use console.log to see what's going on with my code (I'd previously used window.alert).

**Thoughts:** This is a big blow. I really want to get out of copywriting and get an entry-level developer job, but "entry-level" jobs are few and far between. All I can do is keep going and hope that someone eventually gives me a break, as I am capable of doing far more than writing copy. I've posted the test here because I really want to know what it was I couldn't see. I'm out of the running for the job, so any advice you give isn't helping me cheat; it's just helping me be ready for the next coding test.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I missed yesterday -- sort of -- due to running a half marathon, then working in the evening. I say "sort of" because I did begin Googling for resources to complete my next project, which is the FCC weather app, but I did not push any code. I also received a JavaScript test for a developer job I applied to, which involves manipulating a complex data structure. However, I will be unable to share that code publicly.

Today, I built the skeleton for my weather app. In addition to the weather, I am going to have it display the date and time at the top of the page. Right now, it displays the date and time, and there's a button for Farenheit and Celsius, but the button does not yet do anything.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be quite challenging, and I may spend more time figuring out how to do things, such as call an API, then I actually will coding. I'm somewhat used to this from my work as a copywriter. I spend far more time researching my articles/blogs/web content than I actually spend writing.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Random Quote Generator is in the refrigerator and uploaded to Codepen!

**Thoughts:** In addition to Tweeting out the quote, the tweetIt() JavaScript function also appends the hashtag "#quote" and the site URL to the end of the Tweet. 

I had thought of modifying the "New Quote" button, but in light of the new background image I selected, I thought that the default looked elegant. Also, I learned how to use Google Fonts to modify the default Bootstrap font, and I learned how to center a footer in Bootstrap.

I decided not to add the clock and date at this time, because I want to move onto the next project. I don't want to get so caught up in doing this one that I spend forever "perfecting" it. I can build a fancier version later.

While searching for instructions on how to Tweet dynamic text, I came across [this interesting page,](http://lab.artlung.com/random-cells/) which has the user choose random words and then Tweet the resulting "quote." I bookmarked it because I may want to duplicate it later.

[My Repository for My Random Quote Machine](https://github.com/trothaar/random-quote-generator)

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time making the world's simplest random code generator look a little nicer by editing the CSS. Among other edits, I:

* Added a body onload() so that the page displays an initial random quote upon load.
* Added a background image, which I'll likely change, because the current one may look a little too much like something you'd have seen on an ugly-ass 90s-era Geocities site.
* Replaced the Bootstrap Jumbotron class with a page header and a well to hold the quote.
* Centered the well on the page and made the quote text bigger.

I also added a Twitter icon, but it doesn't currently do anything.

**Thoughts:** I spent some time looking at other students' quote machines and figuring out how I wanted mine to look. I finally decided on a style that was a mash-up between [the original FCC model](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/) and [the Epiphany Clock](http://codepen.io/sok213/full/NqJYzb/). I think I might like to add the date and time at the top, but first, I need to get the Twitter button working so that users can Tweet out the quote.

Finally, I reviewed the difference between a CSS class and a CSS id.

[My Repository for My Random Quote Machine](https://github.com/trothaar/random-quote-generator)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I built the skeleton of the Random Quote Generator, meaning that I put together a very, very simple page with nearly no formatting and no Tweet button. It does not look very nice, but it generates random quotes. My logic is that I wanted to get a simple version working, then build upon it. I also created a repository for this particular project.

I used an array of quotes, as I already had a bunch of inspirational quotes stored in a Word doc; I Tweet them for one of my clients (I work as a marketing consultant, primarily for cyber security firms). 

Additionally, although this isn't code-releated, I put together a Medium publication that I can use to write more extensive blogs regarding this project and other things that I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to get the JavaScript working, as I made a couple of minor syntax errors. I couldn't get the array working at all. It turned out that when I copied and pasted the quotes from a text document, the quotation marks around the quotes messed up the array! Sometimes, it's the simple things that stymie us.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commenced working on the Free Code Camp Random Quote Machine Project. Made a local folder and set up the skeletons for my html, css, and js files, as well as a text file containing the quotes I want to use. Began learning to use GitHub markdown so that I can keep this log.

**Thoughts:** I decided to work on this project locally, using Atom, then upload it to CodePen once it is finished. However, if I'm going to do that, I suppose I need to set up a blog so that I can better share my progress, as I will not have any live files to link to until the end. For now, I'm linking to the FCC instruction page.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
