## Captain's Log

### R1D21 - December 21, 2017
Missed yesterday, but made up for it today by coding for about three hours. Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished video 34 on the Poke Dashboard API. Kept getting a JSON.parse error. Tore my hair out trying to figure it out, then finally Googled it and found an answer on StackOverflow suggesting that I look at the network console. I found that it was a typo in my code. Should have just Googled the error to begin with.

### R1D20 - December 19, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished videos 32 & 33 on the Poke Dashboard API. Learned how to use React-Bootstrap.

### R1D19 - December 18, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished the first video tutorial working with the Poke Dashboard API. I ran into a problem -- the API URL provided in the video was no longer valid -- and was able to figure it out and fix it myself. I feel like I know nothing, but since I could do that, I suppose I know something.

### R1D18 - December 17, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Learned about Create React App, which was a game-changer for me. I absolutely hate Webpack. Began the next series of videos, which involve building apps that work with the Poke Dashboard API.

### R1D17 - December 16, 2017
Finished JSX Transformer video in React from the Ground Up. Wrestled with Webpack. Was stumped until I Googled the error message and found a solution on StackOverflow. I should have started with Googling the error message; I would have saved a lot of time.

### R1D16 - December 14, 2017
Didn't get anywhere near as much done as I did yesterday, but I did start the first project in the React from the Ground Up course, a JSX transformer.

### R1D15 - December 13, 2017
I figured out what happened last night. I was working off of a OneDrive folder, and OneDrive flipped out over all of the dependency files that I tried to install. I just switched from Mac to PC earlier this year and am still getting used to it. I put everything on my local drive and started all over again. This time, I was able to get Webpack installed and a local server running. I ran into a couple of problems along the way, but I figured them out on my own! Tomorrow, I'll start building React projects.

### R1D14 - December 12, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Managed to install NodeJS and got a crash course on the Windows Command Line. Couldn't get my NodeJS server running; it appears I didn't install all of the dependencies properly. I'm going to start over again tomorrow.

### R1D13 - December 11, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Watched the 1st video about installing NodeJS and Webpack, which I'll need for the course projects. I'll definitely need to watch this again tomorrow, as it's the end of a long day.

### R1D12 - December 10, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Made some more changes to my counter for ES6 best practices and watched video on higher-order components.

### R1D11 - December 9, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Refactored my counter to use ES6.

### R1D10 - December 8, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Refactored my counter program to make the components reusable, then began work on my ES6 build challenge, which involves taking my counter and refactoring it to use ES6.

### R1D9 - December 7, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. I realized that I had inadvertently not watched one of the component lifecycle videos, so I went through that one. Next is my ES6 build challenge.

### R1D8 - December 6, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the videos about the component lifecycle and began learning about ES6. I like ES6; it seems to be more straightforward.

### R1D7 - December 5, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned about a few ways to refactor my counter code and make it better and more reusable. Also started learning about stateless functional components and the component lifecycle. There's a lot to take in; I'm going to have to code a bunch of projects to understand it all.

### R1D6 - December 4, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the state build challenge and took it one step further; I added a RESET button so that users can set the counter back to zero. The finished product can be seen [here on CodePen.](https://codepen.io/teresarothaar/full/GOeYxy/) It's not much to look at, but it's a start!

### R1D5 - December 3, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Began preliminary work on the state build challenge (counter); outlined how to set up the app.

### R1D4 - December 2, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use state within React components. I went a little further and learned how to clear my input box. I also looked up how to use separate .jsx files, as I don't like writing inline scripts. I learned that Chrome won't serve them except through HTTP; Firefox, however, will. Also began working on the state build challenge (counter).

### R1D3 - December 1, 2017
Completed Lesson 5 of React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use props.

### R1D2 - November 30, 2017
Went through Lessons 3 and 4 of React from the Ground Up today. I learned about React classes and components and the difference between LET and VAR in JS.

### R1D1 - November 29, 2017
I decided to start working through the Udemy courses I purchased prior to my cancer diagnosis. Began React from the Ground Up today and wrote two versions of "Hello World," one in plain JS and the other using JSX.
