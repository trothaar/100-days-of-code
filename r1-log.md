## Captain's Log

### R1D1 - November 29, 2017
I decided to start working through the Udemy courses I purchased prior to my cancer diagnosis. Began React from the Ground Up today and wrote two versions of "Hello World," one in plain JS and the other using JSX.

### R1D2 - November 30, 2017
Went through Lessons 3 and 4 of React from the Ground Up today. I learned about React classes and components and the difference between LET and VAR in JS.
