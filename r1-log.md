The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [November 30, 2017].

## Captain's Log

### R1D8 - December 6, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the videos about the component lifecycle and began learning about ES6. I like ES6; it seems to be more straightforward.

### R1D7 - December 5, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned about a few ways to refactor my counter code and make it better and more reusable. Also started learning about stateless functional components and the component lifecycle. There's a lot to take in; I'm going to have to code a bunch of projects to understand it all.

### R1D6 - December 4, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the state build challenge and took it one step further; I added a RESET button so that users can set the counter back to zero. The finished product can be seen [here on CodePen.](https://codepen.io/teresarothaar/full/GOeYxy/) It's not much to look at, but it's a start!

### R1D5 - December 3, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Began preliminary work on the state build challenge (counter); outlined how to set up the app.

### R1D4 - December 2, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use state within React components. I went a little further and learned how to clear my input box. I also looked up how to use separate .jsx files, as I don't like writing inline scripts. I learned that Chrome won't serve them except through HTTP; Firefox, however, will. Also began working on the state build challenge (counter).

### R1D3 - December 1, 2017
Completed Lesson 5 of React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use props.

### R1D2 - November 30, 2017
Went through Lessons 3 and 4 of React from the Ground Up today. I learned about React classes and components and the difference between LET and VAR in JS.

### R1D1 - November 29, 2017
I decided to start working through the Udemy courses I purchased prior to my cancer diagnosis. Began React from the Ground Up today and wrote two versions of "Hello World," one in plain JS and the other using JSX.
