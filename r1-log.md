The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [November 30, 2017].

## Captain's Log

### R1D49 - February 16, 2018
Began the Building Database Applications in PHP course. Learned about the basics of OOP in PHP.

### R1D48 - February 15, 2018
Completed the Introduction to SQL course. Constructed and ran queries on a small many-to-many database. Next up is the Building Database Applications in PHP course.

### R1D47 - February 14, 2018
Nearly done with the Introduction to SQL course. A lot of it is about relational DB design and data models, which I learned about during my 2nd master's, so it's a review for me. Constructed two simple mySQL databases using MAMP.

### R1D46 - February 12, 2018
Began work on the Introduction to SQL course.

### R1D45 - February 9, 2018
Completed the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, which concludes the Building Web Applications in PHP course. Now it's on to the next course in the series, which is Introduction to SQL.

### R1D44 - February 8, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP course. Continued work on the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Dug a little deeper into the cybersecurity aspects and learned how salted password hashing works.

### R1D43 - February 7, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP course. Began preliminary work on the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

### R1D42 - February 6, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP course. Learned about how PHP works with HTML forms, the differences between GET and POST, and the MVC.

### R1D41 - February 5, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP course. Finished the Password Cracker assignment!

### R1D40 - February 2, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP Coursera course. Began preliminary work on the Password Cracker assignment.

### R1D39 - February 1, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP Coursera course. Installed ngrok and ran the "guessing game" assignment through the auto-grader. Learned about PHP functions; took the week 7 quiz.

### R1D38 - January 31, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP Coursera course. Learned about PHP arrays; took the week 6 quiz and worked on the assignment. Need to install ngrok so I can run it through the auto-grader.

### R1D37 - January 30, 2018
Continued with the Building Web Applications in PHP Coursera course. Installed MAMP, watched all of the Week 5 intro to PHP videos, and took and passed the week 5 quiz.

### R1D36 - January 29, 2018
Blew through Weeks 2 and 3 of the course because they were HTML & CSS reviews; I have a good grasp of HTML/CSS. Now I need to install MAMP and begin the PHP portion of the course.

### R1D35 - January 28, 2018
Finished the Week 1 assignments in the Building Web Applications in PHP Coursera course. Learned about the request-response cycle. Weeks 2 and 3 are a review of HTML and CSS, so I'll probably blow through those quickly.

### R1D34 - January 27, 2018
Starting over again after falling off the wagon for a while. I've been struggling because my ultimate goal is to get into the technical aspects of cyber security. Currently, I'm a cyber security copywriter; I don't want to do this forever. I've been trying to figure out how to get from where I am now, to where I want to go. Everyone I ask gives me different advice, and some of it is not realistic for me; I can't afford to work unpaid internships, for example.

I noticed that Dr. Chuck from UM has a new specialization on Coursera on building web apps in PHP. These courses are geared more towards back-end web development, which appears to be the path I should take if my goal is to secure websites and apps as opposed to making sites look pretty. I previously took his Python course and enjoy his instruction style. I signed up for the course and committed to it today.

### R1D33 - January 9, 2018
Finished the official React tutorial. Thinking of building a markdown previewer next.

### R1D32 - January 8, 2018
Started working through the official React tutorial and building a Tic Tac Toe game.

### R1D31 - January 6, 2018
Watched another Redux video on React from the Ground Up.

### R1D30 - January 5, 2018
Worked through some more of the React section of the Free Code Camp beta and also poked around the official React blog and tutorial.

### R1D29 - January 3, 2018
I decided to finish the React from the Ground Up course before moving on to a project, or at least try to finish it concurrently, so I worked through the next Redux video.

### R1D28 - January 2, 2018
Watched some of the Redux videos on React from the Ground Up and poked around the Free Code Camp Beta React challenges. I think I've gone through enough tutorials and need to dig into a project.

### R1D27 - December 31, 2017
Continued working through the React tutorials on the Free Code Camp Beta.

### R1D26 - December 30, 2017
Worked through some of the React tutorials on the Free Code Camp Beta.

### R1D25 - December 29, 2017
Completed the Pokemon Dashboard project in React from the Ground Up. Ran into a lot of problems because the tutorial was based on React 15, and I had set the dependency for 16. I had to tell my package.json file to use 15, delete the node files, clear the npm cache, reinstall everything, and deal with some additional error messages. It took four hours, but I figured everything out and finished.

### R1D24 - December 27, 2017
1) Worked through some of the npm challenges on the Free Code Camp Beta. Learned more about package.json, which I was introduced to in the React from the Ground Up Course.
2) Completed another lesson in React from the Ground Up; learned about the React Bootstrap Modal feature.

### R1D23 - December 26, 2017
Did some more QA work on the Free Code Camp Beta. Worked through more of React from the Ground Up.

### R1D22 - December 23, 2017
Poked around the new challenges on Free Code Camp Beta. After finding a bunch of errors that others had already encountered, I submitted a new issue to Github.

### R1D21 - December 21, 2017
Missed yesterday, but made up for it today by coding for about three hours. Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished video 34 on the Poke Dashboard API. Kept getting a JSON.parse error. Tore my hair out trying to figure it out, then finally Googled it and found an answer on StackOverflow suggesting that I look at the network console. I found that it was a typo in my code. Should have just Googled the error to begin with.

### R1D20 - December 19, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished videos 32 & 33 on the Poke Dashboard API. Learned how to use React-Bootstrap.

### R1D19 - December 18, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Finished the first video tutorial working with the Poke Dashboard API. I ran into a problem -- the API URL provided in the video was no longer valid -- and was able to figure it out and fix it myself. I feel like I know nothing, but since I could do that, I suppose I know something.

### R1D18 - December 17, 2017
Continued React from the Ground Up. Learned about Create React App, which was a game-changer for me. I absolutely hate Webpack. Began the next series of videos, which involve building apps that work with the Poke Dashboard API.

### R1D17 - December 16, 2017
Finished JSX Transformer video in React from the Ground Up. Wrestled with Webpack. Was stumped until I Googled the error message and found a solution on StackOverflow. I should have started with Googling the error message; I would have saved a lot of time.

### R1D16 - December 14, 2017
Didn't get anywhere near as much done as I did yesterday, but I did start the first project in the React from the Ground Up course, a JSX transformer.

### R1D15 - December 13, 2017
I figured out what happened last night. I was working off of a OneDrive folder, and OneDrive flipped out over all of the dependency files that I tried to install. I just switched from Mac to PC earlier this year and am still getting used to it. I put everything on my local drive and started all over again. This time, I was able to get Webpack installed and a local server running. I ran into a couple of problems along the way, but I figured them out on my own! Tomorrow, I'll start building React projects.

### R1D14 - December 12, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Managed to install NodeJS and got a crash course on the Windows Command Line. Couldn't get my NodeJS server running; it appears I didn't install all of the dependencies properly. I'm going to start over again tomorrow.

### R1D13 - December 11, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Watched the 1st video about installing NodeJS and Webpack, which I'll need for the course projects. I'll definitely need to watch this again tomorrow, as it's the end of a long day.

### R1D12 - December 10, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Made some more changes to my counter for ES6 best practices and watched video on higher-order components.

### R1D11 - December 9, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Refactored my counter to use ES6.

### R1D10 - December 8, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Refactored my counter program to make the components reusable, then began work on my ES6 build challenge, which involves taking my counter and refactoring it to use ES6.

### R1D9 - December 7, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. I realized that I had inadvertently not watched one of the component lifecycle videos, so I went through that one. Next is my ES6 build challenge.

### R1D8 - December 6, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the videos about the component lifecycle and began learning about ES6. I like ES6; it seems to be more straightforward.

### R1D7 - December 5, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned about a few ways to refactor my counter code and make it better and more reusable. Also started learning about stateless functional components and the component lifecycle. There's a lot to take in; I'm going to have to code a bunch of projects to understand it all.

### R1D6 - December 4, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Finished the state build challenge and took it one step further; I added a RESET button so that users can set the counter back to zero. The finished product can be seen [here on CodePen.](https://codepen.io/teresarothaar/full/GOeYxy/) It's not much to look at, but it's a start!

### R1D5 - December 3, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Began preliminary work on the state build challenge (counter); outlined how to set up the app.

### R1D4 - December 2, 2017
Continued with React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use state within React components. I went a little further and learned how to clear my input box. I also looked up how to use separate .jsx files, as I don't like writing inline scripts. I learned that Chrome won't serve them except through HTTP; Firefox, however, will. Also began working on the state build challenge (counter).

### R1D3 - December 1, 2017
Completed Lesson 5 of React from the Ground Up. Learned how to use props.

### R1D2 - November 30, 2017
Went through Lessons 3 and 4 of React from the Ground Up today. I learned about React classes and components and the difference between LET and VAR in JS.

### R1D1 - November 29, 2017
I decided to start working through the Udemy courses I purchased prior to my cancer diagnosis. Began React from the Ground Up today and wrote two versions of "Hello World," one in plain JS and the other using JSX.
